### Adaptive Multiple Choice ###

#### Notes ####
This problem type was created as a student project by David Sall at Harvard. Basic functionality is there, but it's still under construction.

**Known Issues and Upcoming Features:**

* Better logging - we should be able to track a student's whole path through the material, not just their final item.
* The slide animation doesn't work very well for the MC questions. Not sure what's going on yet.
* Improve accessibility for screen readers.
* Default explanatory text.
