### Learner Backpack

#### Current Status

Initial stages.

#### Overview

This problem does two things.

First, it gives you a real simple "Click here if you read it" problem.

Second, and more importantly, it's part of a larger effort to allow edX course authors to store data that goes along with a learner and is kept on the edX server.

#### Creating Your Own Learner Backpack

#### Files:

Inside you will find many pieces used to create this problem:

- `jschannel.js`: the javascript file that allows javascript-type problems to work at all. You should not need to change this. I didn't make this one.
- `backpack.js`: the javascript file that does the majority of the work. You should not need to change this.
- `backpack.html`: the HTML file that will be iframed into the page. You should not need to change this.
- `backpack.xml`: the XML used to create the problem within Studio. You will need to make changes to this, but you only need to replace the prompt with your own.
